Using Python and a combination of libraries such as requests, pandas, openpyxl, and lxml, I developed a script that scrapes data from Moneycontrol's mutual 
fund performance tracker. This script retrieves performance data for various fund categories, including Large Cap, Large and Mid Cap, ELSS, Focused, and more. ðŸ“ˆ
During the development process, I encountered several challenges. Firstly, I had to handle the dynamic nature of the website's HTML structure, which required 
me to employ regex and the lxml library to preprocess the HTML source. Additionally, I had to extract data from multiple tables on each webpage and consolidate 
it into a meaningful format for further analysis. ðŸ§©
To overcome these challenges, I leveraged the power of pandas and openpyxl libraries. I used pandas' read_html function to extract tables from the 
HTML source and transformed the data into pandas dataframes. Then, I utilized openpyxl to create a workbook, create sheets for each fund category, 
and populate the data in an organized manner. ðŸ’ª
The resulting code generates an Excel workbook, "MutualFunds.xlsx," with sheets for each fund category and a separate sheet, "Best Mutual Funds," 
that highlights funds meeting specific criteria. The criteria for selection include a 3-year return greater than 20%, a Crisil rank of 1 or 2, and
filtering out sponsored funds. ðŸ“Š
By utilizing this code, investors and financial enthusiasts can quickly identify the best-performing mutual funds based on predefined criteria. 
This not only saves time but also enables informed investment decisions. ðŸ’¼
